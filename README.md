# Cloud Computing Homework Project

- This was the project for the Cloud Computing Couse, using Docker and Kubernetes containers orchestration
- App components were built using provided code during the semester
- For Docker Stack, I used the online environment called Play with Docker
- For Kubernetes, I deployed the application on a local cluster, using kind


## Docker

The entire app can be deployed as a Docker Stack. The .yml file can be found in the <b>Docker</b> folder 

## Kubernetes

The Kubernetes folder contains all the necessary files for deploying the app, including the kind configuration file for creating a local cluster with one control plane and two workers.
